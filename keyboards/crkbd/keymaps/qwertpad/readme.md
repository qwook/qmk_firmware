# konomu's one handed keyboard

The concept of the Frogpad was first devised around April of 1997 by 
Ryozo "Ken" Tsubai and its design was finalized around February of 2004 
by Tsubai and Linda Marroquin. The original is a small, portable 
keyboard designed to be used with one hand, while allowing the full 
usage of a regular keyboard.

Please keep in mind this keymap can be used as is, but is best implemented into an existing keyboard layout. This can be done by copying the layers found in the keymap.c and pasting them into your keymap. You must add the combos.def into your keymap folder and add these lines of code into the following files:

```
#include "g/keymap_combo.h"
#define _FROG
#define _SYM
#define _NUM
#define _EXT
 
layer_state_t layer_state_set_user(layer_state_t state) {
    combo_disable();
    if (layer_state_cmp(state, _FROG)) {
        combo_enable();
    }
    return state;
}
```

in your keymap.c

```
VPATH  +=  keyboards/gboards/
COMBO_ENABLE = yes
EXTRAKEY_ENABLE = yes
```

in your rules.mk

```
#define COMBO_COUNT 16
#define COMBO_TERM 60
```

in your config.h



## Improvements over the original frogpad

* Significantly improved same finger bigram frequency. (Less S-bigrams)
* Significantly improved neighbor finger bigram frequency. (More N-bigrams)
* Slight improvement in surface layer letter frequency. (Moved G and C to surface layer, in exchange for P and Y)
	* This means you'll need to chord letters less.
* In the case of same finger bigrams, increased the amount of downward motions, which are more comfortable.
	* For example, swapping A and I was an efficient change because 'ea' and 'ie' are both more common than 'ae' and 'ei'.

## Guidelines for usage
<p>The defined COMBO_TERM in the config.h is set to 60, which means that to type a letter on the combo layer, you must hit both keys
(it doesn't matter in which order) within 60 milliseconds of each other to produce that letter. I find that this value is most optimal for 
avoiding errors. Sometimes, if you hit the spacebar too early after a key, it'll produce a comboed letterâ€”and other times, you'll find that you
didn't hit the two keys fast enough to produce that comboed letter, instead, sending a surface layer letter and a space. These errors will
reduce naturally with practice. If you want, you can tweak this COMBO_TERM value to your liking.</p>
<p>Although it is possible to type two comboed letters quickly by pressing the initial comboed letter and then quickly rolling to the next, 
I don't recommend it. I personally find that I can't reliably type the double comboed letters quickly enough, and instead find myself with
one comboed letter and another surface layer letter. This is why when I want to type two or more comboed letters in a row, I press 
space multiple times.</p>
